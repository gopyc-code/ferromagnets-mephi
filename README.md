# Investigation of Ferromagnets in Alternating Magnetic Field

## About
This project provides Python code for processing experimental data from Lab Work 8 at the MEPhI Electricity and Magnetism Laboratory, enabling accurate calculations and visualization of ferromagnetic properties in alternating magnetic fields observed in ferromagnetic rods. Errors are estimated using the [`pyprecision`](https://github.com/gopyc-code/pyprecision) package, and visualizes the results for both long and short rods. The generation of graphs and tables is automated.

### Quantities Obtained
- Magnetic flux density \(B\) with uncertainties.
- Magnetic field intensity \(H\) with uncertainties.
- Magnetic permeability \(\mu = B / (\mu_0 H)\) with uncertainties.
- Remanent flux density \(B_r\) and coercive field \(H_c\) from hysteresis loops.
- Saturation flux density \(B_s\) and corresponding field \(H_s\).
- Hysteresis loop area \(\sigma\) and specific energy loss \(w\) with uncertainties.
- Power loss \(P\) calculated from loop area.

### Visualizations
- **B-H curves** for long and short rods (magnetic flux density vs. field intensity).
- **Î¼-H curves** showing the dependence of magnetic permeability on the field intensity.
- **Hysteresis loops** for long and short rods, including error bars and spline interpolation.
- Graphical representation of remanence \(B_r\), coercive field \(H_c\), saturation points \(B_s\) and \(H_s\), and calculated areas.

## Features
- Error propagation and rounding using the [`pyprecision`](https://github.com/gopyc-code/pyprecision) package.
- Automatic generation of high-resolution graphs and Excel tables.
- Supports analysis of both major magnetization curves and limiting hysteresis loops.
- Uses `scipy` for interpolation and numerical integration.
- Provides reproducible results and automated visual reports.
